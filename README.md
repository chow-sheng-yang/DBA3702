This app is an interactive dashboard designed to automate data-wrangling processeses for epidemiologists (target audience) and help the visualise timely updates. In an attempt to reflect realistic events, population disease data was taken from COVID-19 cases in Singapore in 2020, and other features such as postal codes, addresses and coordinates were randomly simulated from various data sources. The dirty data was pre-processed using techniques such as text-mining, monte-carlo simulations, and feature engineering to produce a new and usable dataset, which is then fetced into the UI/Server and translated into the visual charts displayed on the app. The main page includes a leaflet and ggmap displaying the distribution of cases in Singapore, with various interactions such as filters and map themes. The second page displays graphical distribution of the cases using plots, gganimations and a wordcloud. 

_Maps used for this project are requested from Google Maps Static API._
