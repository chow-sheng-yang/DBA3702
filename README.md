This app is a one-stop platform inclusive of an interactive dashboard designed to automate data-wrangling processeses for epidemiologists (target audience). As large-scaled epidemics often involve hundreds of thousands of data being updated frequently, it is inefficient for researchers to manually import, clean and visualise this data. 

In an attempt to reflect realistic events, the base data is taken from COVID-19 cases in Singapore in 2020 along with other simulated attributes such as postal codes, addresses and coordinates. A series of code functions is defined in a separate Rmd to help researchers quickly update, clean and transform the dirty data (and any new ones) as an epidemic situation changes over time. Some of the techniques used include text-mining/cleaning, sampling based on distribution, discretising and creating calculated attributes (e.g duration of symptoms). The useable data is stored in CSV format and imported into the UI/Server to churn out interactive charts and graphs for researchers to visualise insights better.
